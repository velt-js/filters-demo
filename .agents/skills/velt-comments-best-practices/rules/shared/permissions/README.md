# Moderation & Permissions

**Status:** Limited Documentation

This category covers access control and moderation features for Velt Comments.

## Available Information

Based on documentation search, moderation and permissions are primarily handled through:

1. **User Roles via JWT Token**: Assign Editor or Viewer roles per resource
2. **Organization-based Access**: Users can only access documents within their organization by default
3. **Private Comments**: Comments can be marked as private

## What's Known

### Access Control Roles

From https://docs.velt.dev/get-started/quickstart:
> Assign users as **Editor** or **Viewer** per resource (organization, folder, document) via your JWT token permissions or backend access APIs. Editors can write collaboration data (e.g., add/edit comments); Viewers are read-only.

### JWT Token Permissions

Permissions are configured through the JWT token generated by your backend. See the authentication documentation for details on token structure.

### Organization Isolation

By default, users can only access documents within their own organization. Cross-organization access requires explicit configuration.
